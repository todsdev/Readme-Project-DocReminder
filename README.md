  <!-- # Short Description -->

>- The user can add **Docs** with *images*, *title* and *expiration date* (if necessary), also allowing the user to save the files easily
>- The *images* can be added from the *gallery* or *camera*
>- It is possible to *update*, *delete* and *recover* any **Docs** easily

This application is a scope of an idea that it is not complex itself but it is pretty meaningful to me. It was the first idea that my wife and I had
when I started studying for become an **Android Developer**. \
The idea itself was a simple application that allows the user to create document registrations in his cellphone in order to link it's *expiration date* and
it's information, such as *title* and *images*. It will allow the users the storage **Docs** locally and remotely in order to keep those files safe and keep them as much as it is necessary,
and then have all this information together to easily access and avoid losing any own benefits. \
This is the first version updated from the scope previously released, with so much more details, complexity and power. Check it out!

  <!-- # Short Description -->

>- The user can add **Documents** with *images*, *title* and *validity*
>- The *images* can be added from the *gallery* or *camera*
>- It is possible to *delete* and *recover* any **Document** easily

This application is a scope of an idea that it is not complex itself but it is pretty meaningful to me. It was the first idea that my wife and I had
when I started studying for become an **Android Developer**. \
The idea itself was a simple application that allows the user to create document registrations in his cellphone in order to link it's validity and
it's image. It would allow any user to match, for example, one document that have 2 years validity purchase and you will have it saved locally (with further improvements in the cloud),
and then have all this information together ti easily access and avoid losing any own benefits. \
This application, as I said is a scoupe and I intend to improve it properly with time.

# Code Example
```kotlin
private fun itemTouchHelperCallback(): ItemTouchHelper.SimpleCallback {
        return object: ItemTouchHelper
        .SimpleCallback(0, ItemTouchHelper.LEFT or ItemTouchHelper.RIGHT) {
            override fun onMove(
                recyclerView: RecyclerView,
                viewHolder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder,
                target: RecyclerView.ViewHolder
            ): Boolean {
                return false
            }

            override fun onSwiped(viewHolder: RecyclerView.ViewHolder, direction: Int) {
                val doc = adapterDoc.recoverDocPosition(viewHolder.adapterPosition)
                viewModel.onEvent(MainEvents.Delete(doc))
                Snackbar.make(binding.root, "Doc deleted successfully", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
                    .setAction("Undo") {
                        viewModel.onEvent(MainEvents.Restore)
                    }.show()
            }
        }
    }
```

This code above shows the ItemHelper added to the adapter that allows the user to swip the item, right or left, and delete the selected **Document**. \
When the event is triggered, it displays a *Snackbar* that allows the user to **recover** the recently deleted item and replace it on the diplay again. \
The code only displays the request of the action, but not the code of the event itself.
